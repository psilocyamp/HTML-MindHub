              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                  <strong>DIMENSIONS</strong> .IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
                  external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum
                  width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for
                  all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the
                  competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60
                  yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the
                  state competition program that are unable to provide a field
                  that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                  Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
                  inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
                  waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                  leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide
                  an acceptable field may be required to play all their games
                  away.
